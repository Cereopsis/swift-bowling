## functional_game.swift
Swift ten-pin bowling score functional implementation. I thought it would be interesting to compare various degrees of the functional style. Given that scoring a bowling game is fairly trivial, objects sometimes seem a bit heavyweight. My feeling is that there is probably a happy middle ground between OO and Functional and that languages like Swift (and Scala) encourage exploitation of this.
