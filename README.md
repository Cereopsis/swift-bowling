# swift-bowling

I was reading something the other day, I can't exactly remember what but it used calculating bowling scores as an example. I skimmed over it at the time but later thought that it could provide a simple exploration of various degrees of the functional style. Given that scoring a bowling game is fairly trivial, objects sometime seem a bit heavyweight. My feeling is that there is probably a happy middle ground between OO and Functional and that languages like Swift (and Scala) encourage exploitation of this.


## functional_game.swift
Swift more-or less pure functional implementation.
